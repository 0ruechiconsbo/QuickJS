If you want to know more about the plot of Justice League Starcrossed Movie, here is a brief summary:
 
The movie begins with a mysterious spaceship entering Earth's orbit and attacking a military base. The Justice League arrives to stop the invaders, but they are surprised to see that they are Thanagarians, the same race as Hawkgirl. The leader of the Thanagarians, Hro Talak, reveals that he is Hawkgirl's fiancÃ© and that they have come to warn Earth about an impending attack by the Gordanians, a ruthless alien empire. He claims that the only way to stop them is to build a hyperspace bypass generator around the planet, which would create a wormhole and divert the Gordanians' fleet.
 
The Justice League agrees to cooperate with the Thanagarians, except for Batman, who is suspicious of their motives. He discovers that the hyperspace bypass generator is actually a weapon of mass destruction that would destroy Earth and the Gordanians in one blow. He also learns that Hawkgirl has been spying on the Justice League for years and that she knew about the Thanagarians' plan all along. Batman confronts Hawkgirl and exposes her betrayal to her friends.
 
The Justice League is captured by the Thanagarians and imprisoned in their ship. However, with the help of Alfred and J'onn J'onzz, who escaped capture by shape-shifting, they manage to break free and fight their way out. They also rescue Hawkgirl, who has realized her mistake and turned against Hro Talak. The Justice League then races to stop the Thanagarians from activating the hyperspace bypass generator before it's too late.
 
The movie ends with a climactic battle between the Justice League and the Thanagarians over Metropolis. The Justice League manages to destroy the hyperspace bypass generator and save Earth, but at a cost. Hawkgirl decides to leave the Justice League and return to her people, feeling guilty and unworthy of their trust. The other members of the Justice League bid her farewell with mixed feelings of anger, sadness and respect.
